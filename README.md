# DDS Bag Calculator
 Calculate exact bag accounts in DDS inputted into 'numbers.txt' file by the user and outputted to 'finished.txt'.

# Version and Update Log
 0.0.4 - Added in transparency option, would like to add a settings window to customize size in the near future. Also signed my application in the release tab. I should comment my code down to explain exactly what I'm doing.

 0.0.2 - Trying to use a new function for the program, to try and fine tune whats on the window and where at. Planning to expand upon this.

 0.0.1 - GUI version was born...take a look at one of the old images at the bottom...looks ugly but works. This was created with a personal focus of fulfilling orders on DDS, and thought about trying to make it universal for anyone to use.

# How to Run?
 Install Python (3.8 currently works), run 'pip install pyinstaller', then in the directory of main,py, run 'python -m auto_py_to_exe' And import the config file included and convert. 
 
 Alternatively, in build, run main.exe.
 
 Easiest way out of all of these, just install Python if you haven't already, run "pip install -r requirements.txt" and then run "py main.py"
 

# Features
 GUI - User interactive window
 Transparency Function - have your window transparent so you can see through the window, plan to add a setting to set transparency option

# Updates Coming Soon
 Tweaking code to run an TKinter interactive window, what will be included:
###### -add a settings window to customize the size and transparency of the window(maybe add text font setting?)
######  -Get rid of txt files entirely...how to save entry box to variable and dump when refresh button was used
######  -Hopefully a clean look on the GUI
