# DDS Bag Calculator
 Calculate exact bag accounts in DDS inputted into 'numbers.txt' file by the user and outputted to 'finished.txt'.

# Version and Update Log
 0.2 - Trying to use a new function for the program, to try and fine tune whats on the window and where at. Planning to expand upon this.

 0.1 - GUI version was born...take a look at one of the old images at the bottom...looks ugly but works. This was created with a personal focus of fulfilling orders on DDS, and thought about trying to make it universal for anyone to use.

# How to Run?
 Install Python (3.8 currently works), run 'pip install pyinstaller', then in the directory of main,py, run 'python -m auto_py_to_exe' And import the config file included and convert. Alternatively, in build, run main.exe.
 
 Install Python, currently works for 3.8, run 'pip install py2exe', and then in the directory of main.py and setup.py, run 'python setup.py py2exe' in the command prompt. After finished, check dist folder, and run main.exe, everything should be included. Or just run 'python main.py' to open up the program using python(most stable).
 

# Features
 GUI - Has some functionality nad can update from whats in the text box, as intended. Revamping code soon.

# Updates Coming Soon
 Tweaking code to run an TKinter interactive window, what will be included:
###### -Refresh button to refresh the window without running the program over and over
######  -Open file button to open up the 'numbers.txt' file to let user input their orders
######  -Hopefully a clean look on the GUI
