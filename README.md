# Version and Update Log
 0.1.0 - We got settings, you can now customize some font settings, font size, a template message to always tell you what to do or to add a template for your orders and stay organized. Want to have the transparency window less see through? Good news, we added a little slide bar to increase or decrease transparency, .2 being almost see through and 1 being a solid window. Also when you save the settings, it will save into 'options.json' and will use these settings each time you load into the application. Also the background is fully resizeable and would like to work on adding personal images you can use, such as in custom folder and images to customize your calculator the way you want to. 


 0.0.9 - Woah, what an update 4 months later. I have removed the need of needing any txt file, because of my lazy way of doing things prob scared people...silly me. Everything is now done through the input text box. ALSO NOW WE GOT A BACKGROUND IMAGE THAT somewhat RESIZES WITH THE WINDOW! (you don't understand how long I worked on this...it was a huge accomplishment with a simple image...imagine the exe file I'm going to have to test out again...)Anyways...enough rambling, this is just a big rewrite of how things are done simplifying the program. Keep up to date with more updates coming soon

 0.0.4 - Added in transparency option, would like to add a settings window to customize size in the near future. Also signed my application in the release tab. I should comment my code down to explain exactly what I'm doing.

 0.0.2 - Trying to use a new function for the program, to try and fine tune whats on the window and where at. Planning to expand upon this.

 0.0.1 - GUI version was born...take a look at one of the old images at the bottom...looks ugly but works. This was created with a personal focus of fulfilling orders on DDS, and thought about trying to make it universal for anyone to use.

# How to Run?
 Install Python (3.8 currently works), run 'pip install pyinstaller', then in the directory of main,py, run 'python -m auto_py_to_exe' And import the config file included and convert. 
 
 Alternatively, in build, run main.exe.
 
 Easiest way out of all of these, just install Python if you haven't already, run "pip install -r requirements.txt" and then run "py main.py"
 

# Features
 GUI - User interactive window
 Transparency Function - have your window transparent so you can see through the window, plan to add a setting to set transparency option

# Updates Coming Soon
 Tweaking code to run an TKinter interactive window, what will be included:
###### -add a settings window to customize the size and transparency of the window(maybe add text font setting?)
######  -Get rid of txt files entirely...how to save entry box to variable and dump when refresh button was used
######  -Hopefully a clean look on the GUI
